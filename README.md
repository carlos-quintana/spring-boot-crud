## Introduction

This repository will hold a Spring Boot application that works as an **Image Board site**.

The purpose of this is to solidify my knowledge in MVC frameworks and the **Spring Boot** workflow. 

The inspiration for this application comes from the intricate nature of these kind of websites, which poses a formidable challenge to further advance and display my skills.

## Description

(*See the next section to know which features are implemented yet*)

This application will simulate a social media application where different **Users** can make **Submissions**. 
Submissions will contain information given by the user, like a title, a description and **Tags**. Submissions can also belong to a series of pre established **Categories**.

Users will have their own profile page where they can see their **Gallery** containing their own submissions, and visit other users' galleries to see theirs.
Users can interact with other users' submissions by giving a **Like** or leaving a **Comment**.

### Features

- [X] API Endpoint for CRUD operations on the main entity (A submission).

### Showcase

*TO DO*

### Database model

The following is the Entity-Relationship Model of the database:

Currently there is only one table representing the main entity of the application. The next step will be to create a categories table to assign to a submission and the users table that will come with the implementation of the authentication system.
