## Introduction

This repository will hold a Spring Boot application that works as an **Image Board site**.

The purpose of this is to solidify my knowledge in MVC frameworks and the **Spring Boot** workflow. 

The inspiration for this application comes from the intricate nature of these kind of websites, which poses a formidable challenge to further advance and display my skills.

## Description

(*See the next section to know which features are implemented yet*)

This application will simulate a social media application focused on images where different **Users** can make **Submissions**. 
Submissions will contain information given by the user, like a title, a description and **Tags**. Submissions can also belong to a series of pre established **Categories**.

Users will have their own profile page where they can see their **Gallery** containing their own submissions, and visit other users' galleries to see theirs.
Users can interact with other users' submissions by giving a **Like** or leaving a **Comment**.

## Instructions

This is a Spring Boot application built using Maven. You can use your IDE of choice to build and run the project, or you can build a jar file and run it from the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlos-quintana/spring-boot-crud.git

cd spring-boot-crud

./mvnw package

java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access the site at http://localhost:8080/

## Showcase

### Main Submissions listings site:

***Note:** None of these images were made by me. All of the example images were taken from sites where they were posted as having a CC 1.0 license or otherwise marked as Free to use in personal projects without comercial gain. All of the fields presented in this project, including usernames, titles, descriptions and tags are made up and the original authors of the images have no relation with the project. I also plan to compose a list of all of the original sources as to give credit to each one of them. If any of the original authors would like to have their work taken down I encourage them to get in contact with me.*
