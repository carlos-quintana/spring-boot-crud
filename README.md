## Introduction

This repository will hold a Spring Boot application that works as an **Image Board site**.

The purpose of this is to solidify my knowledge in MVC frameworks and the **Spring Boot** workflow. 

The inspiration for this application comes from the intricate nature of these kind of websites, which poses a formidable challenge to further advance and display my skills.

## Description
