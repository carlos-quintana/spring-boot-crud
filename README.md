## Introduction

This repository will hold a Spring Boot application that works as an **Image Board site**.

The purpose of this is to solidify my knowledge in MVC frameworks and the **Spring Boot** workflow. 

The inspiration for this application comes from the intricate nature of these kind of websites, which poses a formidable challenge to further advance and display my skills.

## Description

(*See the next section to know which features are implemented yet*)

This application will simulate a social media application where different **Users** can make **Posts**. 
Posts will contain information submitted by the user, like a title, a description and **Tags**.
